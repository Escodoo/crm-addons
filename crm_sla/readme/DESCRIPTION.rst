The CRM SLA module is a feature of Odoo that allows defining Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for opportunities (leads) generated by the CRM module. The feature offers the possibility to configure multiple priority levels and set up rules for each of them. Rules can be configured based on different fields, such as team, partner, tags and lead priority.
