To start using the CRM SLA module, it is necessary to configure the sales teams to use SLAs and define a calendar for the rules to be applied. Once the sales team is configured, the user can create a new SLA by navigating to the "CRM" application and selecting "SLAs" from the main menu. From there, the user can create a new SLA and configure the rules based on the fields mentioned above. It is also possible to set up notification emails and escalations to ensure that the SLA is being met.

After creating the SLAs, the SLA lines will be populated or updated periodically through a CRON job that is configured during installation. This job will check the leads and apply the SLAs defined for each one, taking into account the rules and priorities that were established in the SLA configuration.
