To start using the CRM SLA module, it is necessary to configure the sales teams to use SLAs and define a calendar for the rules to be applied. Once the sales team is configured, the user can create a new SLA by navigating to the "CRM" application and selecting "SLAs" from the configuration menu. From there, the user can create a new SLA and configure the rules based on the fields mentioned above.

After creating the SLAs, create a new lead and wait for the scheduled action responsible for synchronizing the SLA lines to be executed or force its execution through the technical menu where the scheduled actions are located.
